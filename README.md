# Marty Grah's Chicken

Restaurant webpage for Marty Grah's Chicken for The Odin Project's Restuarant Page Project.

Marty Grah's Chicken is a fictional chicken restaurant featured in the comedy show Late Night @ North Texas, which I used to work on.
The content of the website is comedic in nature, and the design is a bit garish, as is Marty's style, but the underlying code is what's important.
